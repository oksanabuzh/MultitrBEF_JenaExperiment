traits: name of the variable how it is used in analysis; this is for fast and easy typing in R but often not clear for others,,,,,
"longName: a long version of the variable names, that is generally intuitive understandable",,,,,
meaning: a short description of the variable; can contain information about calculation or meaning,,,,,
unit: the measurement unit of the variables; I tried to use SI units; to avoid very height or small numbers I used appropriate translation units.,,,,,
"variable type: says, whether a variable is categorial or numeric (continous) or binary",,,,,
category: p= performance measure; f=functional trait; c=category or help variable needed for calculations,,,,,
