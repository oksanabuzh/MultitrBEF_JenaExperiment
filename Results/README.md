"stats_for_Fig4.csv" - summary statistics (mean, 95% CI, and SD) for the diversuty effcets on fluxess summerised for each group of ecosystem functions (Plant respiration, Herbivory, Decomposition, Predation, Detritus production, and Respiration) and aboveground and belowground subnetworks (AG vs BG: Aboveground, Belowground). See code "Analysis/Fig4.R"
