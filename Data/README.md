# Data

# Files 

`net_ind_fluxes.csv` - plot data for the Jena Experiment with the biodiversity facet data for each plot and trophic network data, including individual fluxes and standing stocks for each trophic group. These Trophic network models are available at PANGAEA (https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.910659). 

`EF_grouped.csv` - grouping of the standing biomass stocks and network flows into the functional categories.

`Plant_Communt_Compos.csv`- species composition data for each plant community.

`traits_st_PlasFons.van.der_NatEcol_Evol_2020.csv` - trait data used to calculate functional trait diversity measures. The trait database was assembled by (van der Plas et al. 2020), using traits measured by (Schroeder-Georgi et al. 2016) for 59 out of the 60 plant species sown in the Jena Biodiversity Experiment (all species except Primula veris), as well as flowering duration and rooting depth from (Roscher et al. 2004, 2013).

`metadata_for_traits_st_PlasFons.van.der_NatEcol_Evol_2020.csv` - metadata for the trait data in `Data/traits_st_PlasFons.van.der_NatEcol_Evol_2020.csv`

## Contents of the folders

### `Shoot_Root_separately/`

Contains data for plant biomass stocks separated into root stock and shoot stock (used only for the comparison of the diversity effects on biomass stocks between aboveground vs. belowground subnetworks).

`Stocks_Shoot_Root.csv` - plant biomass stock separated into root stock and shoot stock for each plot of the Jena Experiment.
`EF_grouped_shoot_root.csv` - grouping of the standing biomass stocks, where plant biomass stock was separated into root stock and shoot stock.
