`Fig.S1_R2_Stocks.R` - code for creating bubble chart showing variance explained by each plant diversity facet for each standing stock (partial R2 from regression models) and for the Total Network Stock (sum of partial R2 for all stocks across the tropic network).


`Fig.S2_R2_Fluxes.R` - code for creating bubble chart showing variance explained by each plant diversity facet for fluxes (partial R2 from regression models) and for the Total Network Energy Flow (sum of partial R2 for all fluxes across the tropic network).


`Fig.S4_bargraph.R` - code for creating plots for the proportion of flows and stocks in the network that were significantly affected by each plant diversity facet when it was fitted last in the model after all other predictors.


`Fig.S6_ R2_SR_vs_FDbranch_alone.R` - code for creating plots for the proportion of variance explained (partial R2) by species richness and FDbranch when each facet fitted alone in the model with Block as a covariate.


`Fig.S7_TableS3_mismatch_stocks_vs_flows.R` - code for creating plots and table testing an overall mismatch between the flow and stock responses to plant diversity facet for each trophic group across aboveground and belowground subnetworks.
